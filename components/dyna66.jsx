                  was not in the team. There was no country’s best opener Tamim
                  Iqbal or experienced all-rounder Mahmudullah Riyad. Najmul
                  Hossain Shanto, who got the leadership a few days ago, got the
                  achievement that even the successful captains of Bangladesh
                  could not get in the last 16 years. Under his leadership,
                  Bangladesh won the Kiwi fortress for the first time in white
                  ball cricket under the power of the pacers.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On Saturday (December 23), the Tigers secured a big 9-wicket
                  win to avoid a whitewash. Chasing 99 runs, the representatives
                  of red and green won after losing 1 wicket with 34.5 overs in
                  hand. The three-game ODI series was ended by a score of 2-1.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Tiger pacers Shoriful Islam, Tanzim Hasan Shakib, and Soumya
                  Sarkar took 3 wickets each. Shanto left the field after
                  winning the team by 51 runs unbeaten.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Bangladesh got their first taste of victory in the impregnable
                  Kiwi fortress in December last year. But that was in Test
                  cricket. This time the representatives of red and green won
                  the white ball cricket as well. That too after 18 ODIs and 9
                  T20Is in the history of the last 16 years.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  On this day, the Kiwis were bowled out for only 98 runs in
                  31.4 overs under the power of Tanzim Shakib, Shoriful, and
                  Soumya. This was their fourth-lowest total in ODIs against
                  their opponents at home. After losing the toss, Kiwi openers
                  Will Young and Rachin Ravindra batted cautiously. But that
                  lasted till 3.5 overs. Because at the end of the fourth over,
                  pacer Tanzim Shakib crushed all the warnings of the Kiwis.
                  Another pacer Shoriful joined him.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  New Zealand lost their first wicket for 16 runs. In the last
                  ball of the fourth over, opener Rachin Ravindra was sent back
                  by pacer Tanjim Shakib. The Kiwi got out for 8 runs off 12
                  balls.
                  <br />
                  Henry Nicholls came to the wicket after Rachin. Shakib also
                  sent this batsman who played the match-winning innings in the
                  second ODI. Nicholls got out with just 1 run in 7.2 overs
                  caught by Shanto off Shakib. After that, captain Tom Latham
                  made a partnership of 36 runs from 55 balls with Young.
                  However, Shoriful did not let them go far.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Latham (21 runs off 34 balls) was bowled directly by pacer
                  Shoriful at 16.3 overs. Meanwhile, opener Young was adamant at
                  the other end even though wickets fell one after another.
                  Shoriful brought him back and brought relief to the Bangladesh
                  camp. He sent the Kiwi opener, who scored 26 runs off 43 balls
                  at 18.4 overs, to a catch by Mehidy Hasan Miraz. Shoriful then
                  bowled Mark Chapman who scored 2 runs at 20.2 overs.
                  <br />
                  Shakib’s third and Bangladesh’s sixth victim was Tom Blundell
                  who scored 4 runs off 17 balls. After Shoriful-Tanjim, Shanta
                  brought in Soumya. He picked up the wickets of Josh Clarkson
                  (16 runs off 23 balls) and Adam Milne (4 runs off 20 balls).
                  He bowled out both of them directly after attacking in two
                  consecutive overs. After that, Soumya returned Aditya Ashok
                  (10 runs from 12 balls). Ashok returned with a catch by
                  Mushfiq at 30.4 overs.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After Ashok, New Zealand got a chance to play 6 more balls.
                  However, Jacob Duffy and William O’Rourke could not get more
                  than 1 run from those 6 balls. In the end, Mustafiz ended the
                  innings by bowling out William ORourke.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  Bangladesh started chasing an easy target. However, Soumya,
                  who played an epic innings of 169 runs in the previous match,
                  could not stay at the crease due to eye problems. In the fifth
                  over of the innings, he had some eye problems. He indicated
                  that he could not see properly. He also gave water to his
                  eyes. But it didn’t work. Then call the physio. His eye drops
                  are monitored. But the problem was not solved. Soumya, who
                  scored 4 runs in 16 balls, was forced to leave the crease.
                  <br />
                  <br />
                  After that, captain Shanto ensured the victory of the team
                  with opener Anamul Haque Bijay. Both continued to bat
                  aggressively. Both of them picked up 69 runs in 9 overs. When
                  Bangladesh was only 15 runs away from victory, Bijay was edged
                  by O’Rourke’s length ball. He scored 37 runs off 33 balls with
                  7 fours before getting out. Standing at the other end, Shanto
                  picked up the eighth fifty of his ODI career. He left the
                  field after securing the team’s victory in an unbeaten innings
                  of 51 runs with 8 fours from 42 balls. On the other side of
                  the crease, Liton Das was unbeaten with 1 run from 2 balls.
                  Chasing 99 runs, Bangladesh’s victory was confirmed in 15.1
                  overs, with 34.5 overs in hand.
